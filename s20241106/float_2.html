    <h2>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h2>

        In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal gardens faster: two
        same-size in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in a frame upon which you straddled. The device was
        propelled by pushing your feet against the ground, thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a sort of
        gliding walk.

        The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was made entirely of wood. This enjoyed a
        short lived popularity as a fad, not being practical for transportation in any other place than a well
        maintained pathway such as in a park or garden.

        The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, when pedals were applied directly to the front
        wheel. This machine was known as the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") as well as the "bone shaker," since its
        wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roads of the day made for an extremely uncomfortable ride. They
        also became a fad and indoor riding academies, similar to roller rinks, could be found in large cities.
